# Welcome to StyleMe! ðŸ‘—ðŸ‘•
We participated in the Google CodeFest by creating a fashion project called StyleMe that helps users organize their clothes on their inventory and generate different outfit combinations of their choosing. 

We used REST APIs to create the endpoints for adding, deleting, shuffle clothing items, Node.js and Express.js to run the web application in the backend, and AngularJS for frontend development. We also used Firebase for user's authentication and to store their information in a database.
